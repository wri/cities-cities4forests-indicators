    "                                                       'methods' : 'This indicator is based on <a href=\"https://eccad3.sedoo.fr/#CAMS-GLOB-ANT\">the CAMS Global Anthropogenic Emissions dataset</a> of the <a href=\"https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/\"> Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS)</a> and <a href=\"https://eccad.aeris-data.fr/\"> ECCAD</a> (Granier et al. 2019). The dataset provides estimates of emissions from 12 sectors of human activity, on a 0.1-degree (approx. 11 km) spatial resolution. The estimates are based on simulations and historical data. The included sectors are: agriculture (livestock); agriculture (soils); agriculture (waste burning); power generation; fugitive emissions; industry; combustion in residential, commercial, and other settings; ships; solvents; solid waste and wastewater; off-road transportation; and on-road transportation.We used Google Earth Engine for spatial subsetting against cities administrative boundaries. We report annual, sector-disaggregated emissions for the years 2010, 2015, and 2020, of the each pollutant species. We report all emissions as tonnes/year. In order to allow comparison of emissions of different pollutant species, we convert tonnes to USD based on social costs per tonne as estimated by <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-015-1343-0\">Shindell 2015</a> for all pollutant species except non-methane volatile organic compounds, or NMVOC. For the social cost of NMVOC, we used the median value for NMVOC emitted below 100m in <a href=\"https://publikationen.bibliothek.kit.edu/1000072046/\"> van der Kamp 2017</a>. Van de Kamp estimates are in 2015 euros, which we converted to 2015 USD at 1 EUR = 1.11 USD. There are limitations to these methods and uncertainty regarding the resulting indicator values. Importantly, the emissions data used for this indicator only account for direct emission from activities within the boundaries of the city (Scope 1). This data does not account for emissions associated with electricity used in the city but generated elsewhere (Scope 2) or emissions produced elsewhere associated with products or services consumed in the city (Scope 3). The CAMS dataset is modeled data based on an ensemble of multiple emissions models and is subject to the limitation of those models. Description of the methods used to develop the CAMS emissions dataset is described <a href=\"https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cams_emissions_general_document_apr2019_v7.pdf\">here.</a>'}, \n",

(A typical human hair has a diameter of 50-70 µm.) PM2.5 are released in combustion (including fuel combustion in vehicles and power plants, as well as naturally occurring fires), degradation of vehicle tires during use, and some chemical processes that occur in the atmosphere. PM2.5 is a serious health concern, because the small size allows PM2.5 particles to travel deep into human lungs, enter the bloodstream, and cause direct damage to internal organs. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 leads to increased incidence of heart and lung diseases, cancers, and premature death. This indicator can help decision-makers determine how many of a city residents face long-term exposure to dangerous levels of PM2.5, and in which neighborhoods these residents live.',\n",

This dataset combines models of atmospheric mixing and chemistry with analysis of imagery from the NASA MODIS, MISR, and SeaWIFS satellite instruments to generate estimates of PM2.5 concentrations near the earth surface. The data are provided at a spatial resolution of 0.01 degrees, or approximately 1.1 km. Our indicator is based on annual average concentrations for 2020. We report each district 2020 average PM2.5 concentration as a percentage of the WHO standard. (The average is the annual average, averaged spatially over the area of the district.) For example, an average concentration of 15 µg/m3 would be reported as 300% of the WHO standard. There are limitations to these methods and uncertainty regarding the resulting indicator values. The PM2.5 dataset has uncertainty related to the limitations of atmospheric modeling methods used.'}, \n",

The scenario variables we use are a 100 year return period, the Business As Usual/Pessimistic (RCP8.5) climate scenario, high sea level rise, no subsidence, and the GFDL-ESM2M riverine projection model. We then compare locations of either projected coastal or riverine flooding to built-up areas in the city in 2020 as defined by the built-up class from <a href=\"https://developers.google.com/earth-engine/datasets/catalog/ESA_WorldCover_v100\">ESA WorldCover</a>.For each city and city district we calculate the number of built-up pixels and the number of built-up pixels projected to experience a flood inundation depth greater than zero. Then we calculate the percent of built-up pixels with flood exposure. Because this indicator considers 2020 built-up in comparison to projected 2050 inundation, it may underestimate built area exposed to the hazard as a result of future land development. Note that this is an indicator of flood hazard and it does not consider how mitigation measures such as flood protection infrastructure (levees, etc.) may impact risk of inundation from flooding under the scenario described.' }, \n",

The dataset provides estimates of emissions from 12 sectors of human activity, on a 0.1-degree (approx. 11 km) spatial resolution. The estimates are based on simulations and historical data. The included sectors are: agriculture (livestock); agriculture (soils); agriculture (waste burning); power generation; fugitive emissions; industry; combustion in residential, commercial, and other settings; ships; solvents; solid waste and wastewater; off-road transportation; and on-road transportation. We used Google Earth Engine for spatial subsetting against cities administrative boundaries. We report annual, sector-disaggregated emissions for the years 2010, 2015, and 2020, of the each pollutant species. We also report emissions of the greenhouse gases, as total CO2e aggregated over sectors for each of the three years. We calculated CO2e based on 20-year and 100-year global warming potentials, as listed in the table. We report all emissions as tonnes/year. There are limitations to these methods and uncertainty regarding the resulting indicator values. The CAMS dataset is modeled data based on an ensemble of multiple emissions models and is subject to the limitation of those models. Description of the methods used to develop the CAMS emissions dataset is described <a href=\"https://atmosphere.copernicus.eu/sites/default/files/2019-06/cams_emissions_general_document_apr2019_v7.pdf\">here</a>.'}, \n",

This 30-meter resolution data layer provides an estimate of total carbon flux from trees from the years 2001 through 2021 inclusive in units of Mg CO2e/hectare. To calculate the mean annual carbon flux for each area of interest, we first unmask the dataset so pixels where the dataset shows no carbon flux are given a value of zero and included in subsequent calculations, apply a mean reducer to the area, and divide the resulting value by 21 to annualize the 21 year dataset. The resulting value estimates the average carbon emissions or removals per hectare from the area of interest during each year in the 21 year period. Negative numbers represent greenhouse gas removals and positive values indicate emissions. There are limitations to these methods and uncertainty regarding the resulting indicator values. The carbon flux model used for the calculations was designed for forests and is based on tree cover as detected by Landsat; it does not pick up or measure carbon flux from sparse tree cover. At 30-meter resolution, Landsat and products developed from it do not pick up isolated trees. Additionally, the model is limited to pixels with tree canopy density >30% and trees of >5 meter height in 2000 or subsequent tree cover gain, so low density or short tree cover is not included.'}, \n",
