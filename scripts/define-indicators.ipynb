(A typical human hair has a diameter of 50-70 µm.) PM2.5 are released in combustion (including fuel combustion in vehicles and power plants, as well as naturally occurring fires), degradation of vehicle tires during use, and some chemical processes that occur in the atmosphere. PM2.5 is a serious health concern, because the small size allows PM2.5 particles to travel deep into human lungs, enter the bloodstream, and cause direct damage to internal organs. Long-term exposure to PM2.5 leads to increased incidence of heart and lung diseases, cancers, and premature death. This indicator can help decision-makers determine how many of a city residents face long-term exposure to dangerous levels of PM2.5, and in which neighborhoods these residents live.',\n",

This dataset combines models of atmospheric mixing and chemistry with analysis of imagery from the NASA MODIS, MISR, and SeaWIFS satellite instruments to generate estimates of PM2.5 concentrations near the earth surface. The data are provided at a spatial resolution of 0.01 degrees, or approximately 1.1 km. Our indicator is based on annual average concentrations for 2020. For population, we used <a href=\"https://www.worldpop.org/\">WorldPop</a> 100m-resolution population estimates for 2020. To generate its population estimates, WorldPop population uses census data and models built on analysis of satellite imagery. For each district, we used Google Earth Engine to estimate the population in areas where the average PM2.5 concentration for 2020 was above <a href=\"https://www.who.int/publications/i/item/9789240034228\">the 2021 WHO standard</a> of 5 µg/m3 (annual average). We divided this high-exposure population by the total district population to get the portion of the population exposed to dangerous levels of PM2.5. We also report each district 2020 average PM2.5 concentration as a percentage of the WHO standard. (The average is the annual average, averaged spatially over the area of the district.) For example, an average concentration of 15 µg/m3 would be reported as 300% of the WHO standard.'}, \n",
